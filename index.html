						<h1> Welcome!!! </h1>
						<p>
							Welcome to the website of Azim Bhayla (Me). This website gives an overview of my life. However this website was created as part of a project, Nontheless most of the information
							is legit, However don't take the information on this page too seriously... and most definatly don't get offended. You can learn about me on other pages of this website. While the 
							rest of this web page is going to cover how I went about creating this website.

						<h1> My Aims</h1>	
						<p>
							My main aim for the website is to create a sleek looking liquid-responsive website as part of my assigment for CS1109 at UCC. This webpage is infact responsive. I achived this by 
							using the mobile first approch (except tables, where I take a different approach). I am basically trying to show off my knowledge of HTML5 and CSS. 
						</p>
						<p>
							My indirect aim would be to create a webpage about my life. I also hope to learn new trick for web-design during the process of making this webpage.

							<h1>Making of the website</h1>	
							<p>
								During the making of this website I encountred many new obsticeles. Many were simply fixed by trail and error like most issues. However there were few isssues that had me troubling 
								in my nighmares. On top of my head there were two main problems I encountred were:
							</p> 
							<ul>
								<li>Equal height columns</li>
								<li>Responsive tables</li>
							</ul>
						</section>
						
						<section>
							<h1>Equal height columns</h1>	
							<p>
								During the making of my website I encountered the problem of producing equal height columns, in my case getting the sidebar (aside)	to be the same as the main. I searched the web
								to find many different solutions but the best that suited be was as provided here, <a href="http://css-tricks.com/fluid-width-equal-height-columns/">Equal height columns</a>.In this solution
								you add a bottom padding of an extreme value and negate the bottom margin of the same value, and allowing the containers overflow to be hidden. Simple as. However in the future flex box might
								be the better solution as it become supported widely.
							</p>
						</section>
						 
						<section>
							<h1>Responsive tables</h1>	
							<p>
								I had tables in my website and they seemed to break at a certain point on small screens, thus I though of making responsive tables. After a great deal of research on my part I discovered it was 
								a difficult problem to solve. There are many solutions but not perfect and neither is the one is used, here is the full article <a href="http://css-tricks.com/responsive-data-tables/">Responsive tables</a>.
								I adapoted the concept and use it to suit my needs, However during the process I noticed this solution only works for table that display information in columns (HTML - the set of information
								is on the same row). I hope to find a solution to this some time in the future.
